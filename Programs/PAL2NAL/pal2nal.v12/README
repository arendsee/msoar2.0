# What is pal2nal?
#------------------#

PAL2NAL is a program that converts a multiple sequence alignment
of proteins and the corresponding DNA (or mRNA) sequences into
a codon-based DNA alignment. The program automatically assigns
the corresponding codon sequence even if the input DNA sequence
has mismatches with the input protein sequence, or contains UTRs,
polyA tails. It can also deal with frame shifts in the input
alignment, which is suitable for the analysis of pseudogenes.
The resulting codon-based DNA alignment can further be subjected
to the calculation of synonymous (Ks) and non-synonymous (Ka)
substitution rates.

#-------#
# Usage
#-------#

Usage:  pal2nal.pl  pep.aln  nuc.fasta  [nuc.fasta...]  [options]

    pep.aln:     protein alignment either in CLUSTAL or FASTA format

                 - works not only a pairwise alignment but also
                   the alignment with more than 2 sequences.

                 - if there are frame shifts in your alignment,
                   you have to specify those positions by numbers:
                   for example '2' in the alignment means that
                   there are only two bases (i.e. one base deletion)
                   (see 'test.aln').


    nuc.fasta:   DNA sequences
                 (single multiple fasta format file,
                  or may be separated files)

    Options:

       -h            Show help

       -output (clustal|paml|fasta|codon)
                     Output format, default = clustal

       -blockonly    Show only user specified blocks
                     '#' under CLUSTAL alignment (see example)

       -nogap        remove columns with gaps and inframe stop codons

       -nomismatch   remove mismatched codons (mismatch between
                     pep and cDNA) from the output

       -codontable (universal|vmitochondria)
                     Codon table
                       - universal (default)
                       - vmitochondria -> vertebrate mitochondrial

       -html         HTML output (only for the web server)

       -nostderr     No STDERR messages (only for the web server)



    - The correspondence of IDs between pep.aln and nuc.fasta is
      automatically checked:
        - If you use the same IDs in both pep.aln and nuc.fasta,
          the sequences don't have to be in the same order.
        - If not, the order of the sequences in pep.aln and nuc.fasta
          has to be the same.

    - IDs in pep.aln are used in the output.


Example:  pal2nal.pl  test.aln  test.nuc  -output paml  -nogap


#---------------------------------#
# How to calculate Ks, Ka values?
#---------------------------------#

To calclate Ks, Ka values, you need the codeml program, which
is included in the PAML package. You can download PAML from

  http://abacus.gene.ucl.ac.uk/software/paml.html

As an example, a control file (test.cnt) and a tree file (test.tree)
are in the "for_paml" sub-directory.

These control file and tree file are designed for the 'test' data
used in PAL2NAL.

Example:

   pal2nal.pl  test.aln  test.nuc  -output paml  -nogap  >  for_paml/test.codon

   cd for_paml

   codeml  test.cnt

     You can find the output of codeml in "test.codeml".
     Ks, Ka values are very end of the output file.
     Just for comparison, there is a sample output file, "test.codeml.ori".
