#	What is MSOAR and MSOAR 2.0
#********************************

MSOAR is a high-throughput system for assigning orthologs between
closely related species on a genome scale. It attempts to reconstruct
the evolutionary history of input genomes in terms of genome rearrangement
and gene duplication events. However, MSOAR is only able to deal with
randomly duplicated genes. 

MSOAR 2.0 incorporates tandem duplications into MSOAR, and combines gene 
phylogeny and genome rearrangement together to assign orthologs. For a pair 
of input genomes, MSOAR 2.0 first focuses on the tandemly duplicated genes 
of each genome and tries to identify among them those that were duplicated 
after the speciation (i.e., the so-called inparalogs), using a phylogenetic
tree reconciliation method. Then it removes most of the duplicated inparalogs 
in tandem position on each genome before MSOAR is invoked. Finally, it goes 
through a post-processing step to further improve the prediction accuracy of
the output ortholog pairs.

#******************************
#	How to run MSOAR 2.0
#******************************

MSOAR 2.0 is written on the platform of Linux and tested on Linux (version 
CentOS-5), we haven't tested it on other platforms. So it is better for the 
user to install and run MSOAR 2.0 on Linux. 

Since MSOAR 2.0 is an integrated pipeline for ortholog assignment, it uses
some other software and programs as a subroutine. So the user needs to install
the following software and programs before running MSOAR2.0.


Install Other Software
-----------------------
	blast-2.2.13/					
	MAFFT/		
	mcl-06-058/					
	MSOAR/ 						
	PAL2NAL/				
	phylip-3.67/

In order to install these software, the user needs to download them under the 
directory /Programs/. Some of them need to be compiled, for example, to compile
the MCL program, simply type:

>> cd mcl-06-058/
>> make

# NOTICE:
# All software have already been included in the package except the blast-2.2.13/
# and MAFFT/ due to their large sizes. User needs to install these two software 
# under the corresponding directories before running MSOAR 2.0.


Compile Programs used in MSOAR 2.0
----------------------------------

Go to the directory /Programs/, simply type:

>> make

to compile all the programs used in MSOAR 2.0.



Run MSOAR 2.0
-------------

After installing all the software and compiling all the programs used in 
MSOAR 2.0, the user need to go to the directory containing the MSOAR2.0 file
and run the MSOAR2.0 executable script as follows:

>> MSOAR2.0 G1.pep G2.pep G1.nuc G2.nuc G1.info G2.info

To run MSOAR 2.0, the MSOAR2.0 script needs six input data files, which are
described below:

G1.pep and G2.pep are the input peptide sequence files for each genome.
G1.nuc and G2.nuc are the corresponding nucleotide sequence files for each genome.
G1.info and G2.info are files containing positional information of genes on each genome.

Formats of the input files are described in the Examples/ section, and examples are 
given in the directory Examples/.

The output of MSOAR 2.0 is stored in the file MSOAR2_result after running the script.
